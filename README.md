# TodoMVC

[ivi](https://github.com/ivijs/ivi) TodoMVC implemented in almost the same way as
[Redux TodoMVC](https://github.com/mweststrate/redux-todomvc) implementations.

## Production Build

Source code in this repository doesn't include advanced compilation pipeline that can be solved nowadays with Rollup and
google closure compiler. Optimized builds with webpack will be possible in the feature when
[this feature](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler-npm/issues/56) is implemented.
