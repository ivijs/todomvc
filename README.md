# TodoMVC

This demo application is implemented as an example of how to implement efficient applications with
[ivi](https://ivijs.github.io/ivi) library. It uses a combination of mutable collections with immutable values for an
application state, connectors for querying data from an application state and lightweight precompiled routing.
